                         Project Title:-  Game for Visually  Challenged(Crazy Dog)


This was my first web development project using HTML,CSS and plain vanilla javascript without using any framework and using sound() library  which alerts blind people about obstacles.

According to a report by the World Health Organization, there are currently 284 million people in the world who are visually impaired, and 39 million people are blind. 
Over 2.2 billion people are blind or visually impaired, and the numbers are rising.

Loss of vision has been linked to loneliness, social isolation, and feelings of worry, anxiety, and fear. Depression is common in people with vision loss. In a recent CDC study, 1 in 4 adults with vision loss reported anxiety or depression.

 The process involved in making a 2-D running graphical computer game with JavaScript. Using JavaScript together with HTML and CSS.
 
 I created a 2-D game where the objective for the player is to Jump over the obstacle whenever the beep sound comes as soon as it approaches the player. 

 How to Play:-


Using sound in the game is one of the basic requirements and of utmost importance if the game is for visually challenged. To add the sound in JavaScript we use audio class in our game to create instances of the audio class by defining the source. When the certain condition is met the inbuilt method sound () gets activated.

In this game first the tutorial will guide the player on how to play. Then it will alert the player about the oncoming objects using the beep sound. When the collision occurs a ‘game over’ sound informs the player of the collision. And when the player hits the enter key the game will restart with a sound.
